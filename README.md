# hw5-workday-planner

Description
-I made this app to practice javascript, bootstrap, moment js, jquery, html, and css.
-I built this for practice, my friend! Also, it is a handy device for scheduling.
-This is a fun workday planner, but until I perfect saving locally, for now, I will stick with my Moleskine planner.
-This project was good practice for all the skills I hope one day to master to a much higher degree.
